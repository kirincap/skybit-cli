# Skybit CLI — Minimal Agent via Crush + MCP

Natural‑language trading with explicit approvals. We run Charm’s Crush as the agent shell and expose Skybit tools via a local MCP HTTP server. The model uses OpenRouter (Opus) and calls tools deterministically; you review a Preview and then type `approve` to execute.

## How it works

1. Login — `skybit login` starts a device‑code browser flow; the CLI holds a short‑lived session token.
2. Link a broker — `skybit brokers connect` opens SnapTrade Connect; you OAuth/MFA with your broker once.
3. Add data — `skybit data add polygon|iex|nasdaq|databento` (your API keys). The CLI streams from vendor websockets; the model uses snapshots for determinism.
4. Chat — `skybit` opens a session. You type plain English; the model proposes a Plan (tool calls) and a Preview (orders, impact, fees if enabled, policy checks).
5. Approve — you confirm inline; we submit via SnapTrade and stream status; everything is logged.
6. Exit — quitting the CLI closes the websocket; no watchers, no daemons.

> **Callout — MCP in this product**
> MCP is the tool layer the LLM calls (e.g., `trade.place_order`, `data.snapshot`). MCP is not a copilot; the chat model provides intent, MCP provides callable tools.

```

- **Policy Engine** - Customizable risk rules (position limits, time windows, etc.)
- **Paper Trading** - Test strategies without real money (default for new users)

- **No Automation** - System only acts on explicit user approval

## System Requirements

- **OS**: macOS 11+, Linux (glibc 2.31+), Windows 10+

- **Network**: Stable internet connection for real-time data
- **Terminal**: Any modern terminal emulator with UTF-8 support

## Configuration

- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (required)
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` (default `anthropic/claude-3-opus`)
- `SNAPTRADE_CLIENT_ID` (required for live orders)
- `SNAPTRADE_CLIENT_SECRET` (required for live orders)
